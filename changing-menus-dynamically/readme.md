Changing Menus Dynamically

It’s often useful to offer the user a choice of inputs via pop-up menus, and to be
able to change the contents of one or more pop-up menus depending on the choice the user makes in another pop-up menu. You’ve probably seen this on Web sites that ask you to choose the country you live in from a pop-up menu and then fill a second menu with state or province names, based on the choice you made. In Listings 6.4 (HTML) and 6.5 (JavaScript), we’re using two pop-up menus A. The first menu is for months. When the user picks
a month, the script populates the second pop-up menu with the correct number of days for the selected month B.
